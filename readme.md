## Simple memory/something game written with raylib and C++.

### How to play:
Repeat the sequence of colors by clicking on the buttons. The sequence will get longer and longer as you progress.

### Notes:
- Only tested on Windows with microsoft compiler, but should work on other platforms as well.
- Sound are made-up by me in about 15 seconds in online sound effect generator, so they are not the best.
- I more of plain ansii C programmer, only used C++ for classes and vectors, so the code might not be the best.
